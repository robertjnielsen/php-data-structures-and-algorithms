## Overview
#### Summary
This repository contains my PHP solutions to various code challenges and data structure challenges presented in the [Code Fellows](https://www.codefellows.org/) 401 level courses.

While Code Fellows does not currently offer any PHP programs or cohorts, I thought that I would apply what I learned during my time in the [ASP.NET](https://www.codefellows.org/courses/code-401/advanced-software-development-in-asp-net-core/) course to the PHP language.

#### Testing
Unit testing was accomplished via the PHPUnit testing framework. All classes / methods are tested and passing before pushing and merging.

## Table Of Contents
##### Code Challenges
1. [Array Reverse](Challenges/ArrayReverse/array_reverse.md)
2. [Insert Shift Array](Challenges/InsertShiftArray/insert_shift_array.md)
3. [Binary Search](Challenges/BinarySearch/binary_search.md)
