## Problem Domain
Write a function called `reverseArray` which takes an array as an argument.

Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with elements in reversed order.

## Inputs & Expected Outputs
|Input|Output|
|:---:|:---:|
|[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]|[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]|
|[2, 5, 1, 7]|[7, 1, 5, 2]|
|[1, 'd', '7', 19, 't']|['t', 19, '7', 'd', 1]|

## Big O / Efficiency
|Time|Space|
|:---:|:---:|
|O(n)|O(1)|

**Time** is considered _O(n)_ because the time it takes to reverse a given array is directly proportional to the number of elements within the array.

**Space** is considered _O(1)_ because nothing new is being instantiated into memory beyond temporary variables that will serve as references during the execution of the operation.
