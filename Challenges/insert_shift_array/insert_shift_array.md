## Problem Domain
Write a function called `insertShiftArray` which takes in an array, and a secondary value as arguments.

Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, the secondary value should be inserted into the middle index of the array, and the remaining elements should be shifted.

## Inputs & Expected Outputs
|Input|Output|
|:---:|:---:|
|[1, 2, 4, 5], 3|[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]|
|['the', 'fish', 'swim', 'fast'], 'can'|['the', 'fish', 'can', 'swim', 'fast']|

## Big O / Efficiency
|Time|Space|
|:---:|:---:|
|O(n)|O(1)|

**Time** is considered _O(n)_ because the number of operations depends entirely on the size of the given array.

**Space** is considered _O(1)_ because nothing new is being instantiated into memory beyond temporary variables that will serve as references during the execution of the operation.
